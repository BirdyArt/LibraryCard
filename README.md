## Development

### Technologies

The primary libraries and dependencies used in the development of LibraryCard are shown below. For a complete list of dependencies, consult the package.json files inside `frontend` and `backend` folders.

| Library                             | Purpose                 | Client or Server? |
|:------------------------------------|:------------------------|:------------------------|
| [React](https://reactjs.org/) | A JavaScript library for building UIs | Client
| [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) | The worldâ€™s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites | Client
| [MongoDB with Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) | Schema-Based MongoDB Application Data Modeling | Server |
| [Express](https://expressjs.com/)       | Backend Server Framework | Server |

### Usage

| (1) Commands (`/frontend`)           | Purpose                           |
|:-----------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| `npm start`                        | Run Frontend Dev. Server          |
| `npm run build`                    | Build Frontend for Production     |

| (2) Commands (`/backend`)         | Purpose                            |
|:---------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| `npm start`                      | Run Backend Server                 |

## Development Environment

Before starting the server in your local dev. environment,the following environment variables should be defined:

| Variable Name               | Description                     |
|:-----------------------------------|:----------------------------|
| ATLAS_URI | MongoDB Atlas connection string (e.g. `mongodb+srv://MONGO_USER:MONGO_PASSWORD@cluster...`) |
| ICONFINDER_API | The Iconfinder API key to authenticate the requests. |
| PORT | Server Port (5000 by default for local deploy). In production Heroku will provide its own port. |

This is accomplished by including the following in the .env file located in the root of the `/backend` directory. This .env file must never be pushed to GitHub since it contains application sensitive information such as the database username and password.
